CP == card-panel values

** develop & testbench ability to create a deck, draw hands & create
the CP list, discard cards, add new cards. A hand is created using
dPanels, dCards to construct a list with CP values.

   match

** insert card selection algorithm into the game playing
   framework. Testbench

** Develop & testbench framework for multiple test fights
