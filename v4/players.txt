1 deck is used (54 cards)  (PROG note, each players hand is composed
of panels not card. 011 is panel 1 from card 01, 012 is panel 2 from
card 01, 120 is panel 0 from card 12, etc)


+ Changes to rules from standard fencing deck:
* All characters draw 7 cards at the start of a fight.
* Rules for "Stunned" instead of "Drop Weapon" (see below).
* All the "counterattack" cards are playable after ANY Blue card
(except Disengage or Stunned).
* You cannot play blue/counterattack during a faceoff. meh, maybe
allow this.
* All discards are face up. 
* Special cards have the text for the tile in reversed colors. A RED
special would have white text with red background around the title
text. A BLUE special would have white test with blue background, etc.
* The text on the cards takes place immediately, before the next card
is played.
* all cards use dthe standard text & names for titles. Special cards
have reversed colors. Text in italics is for flavor only and has no
impact on the rules.
* When a card is played it's effect takes place immediately. When in
doubht, the effects take place in the order that they are written on
the card.
* Playing a card does not effect init unless the card states otherwise.
* If both players "lose" at the same time, then both players draw a
card and go to faceoff. Note, this should only happen during a faceoff
as otherwise one PC will "lose" before the other.


*************************************************************************************
Faceoff Rules:

Both players must play a Red or Blue. If one player has no cards then
they lose the game. If neither player has a card then both draw cards
and try again. If both play Red then the highest Faceoff Value wins
init. If there is a tie then try again. If both play Blue then both
players draw a card and try again regardless of card text (no ca). If
one plays Red and the other Blue the Red player gains the init (ca's
can be played).

OR
All cards can be played for Face-Offs. The Green & Blue Cards have
very low initiative numbers however. (This allows the rules to be a
little bit simpler).


*************************************************************************************
+ Rules for being stunned:
Stunned characters can immediately recover by discarding 3 cards?
Some special cards may allow you to recover from being
stunned. (example: 'Regeneration (BLUE): This card acts as a defense
and also immediately recovers a character from being Stunned').

A Stunned character cannot play Red cards.
A Stunned character cannot play a card which will stun him again.
A Stunned character can be Stunned again with no additional penalties to the stunnee.

*************************************************************************************
When you have initiative you may:
* play a red
* play a green
* draw 2 cards, discard a card, and surrendor the initiative
* recover from being stunned & surrender the initiative
* possible change: You may surrendor the initiative, discard up to
three cards, and draw a card for each card you discarded.
